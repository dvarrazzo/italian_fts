:Abstract: This package provides a dictionary and the other files required to
    perform *full text search* in Italian documents using the PostgreSQL_
    database together with the contrib module Tsearch2_.

    Using the provided dictionary, search operations in Italian documents can
    keep into account morphological variations of Italian words, such as verb
    conjugations.

    This package contains also a Snowball stemmer useful as fallback for words
    not included in the dictionary.

Package description
===================

This package contains both a ispell dictionary and a stemmer library for
Italian language.

The Italian dictionary is distributed in **latin1** and **utf8** encodings. 
This package is in **ENCODING** encoding. Please use the Italian dictionary
only with database clusters created with the according encoding. For instance
if your cluster has been created with ``initdb --locale=it_IT`` (or any 8 bit
encoding) use the latin1 version. If your cluster has been created with 
``initdb --locale=it_IT.utf8`` (or any other multibyte locale) use the utf8 
version. If you want to know the locale of an existing cluster you can use
the command ``psql -tc "SHOW LC_CTYPE" postgres``.


Prerequisites
=============

The ISpell dictionary has been tested with PostgreSQL versions 8.1 and above,
but should work with any PostgreSQL version including the tsearch2 contrib.

The stemming library has only been tested with PostgreSQL 8.2. Furthermore the
tsearch2 package must be patched to make it compatible with the current
Snowball version. The patch is available at
http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/postgres/gist/tsearch/V2/tsearch_snowball_82-20070504.gz

If you don't want to patch the source you can skip the stemmer build and 
install only the spelling dictionary. In this case refer to the `Installing 
only the spelling dictionary`_ section.

To install the Italian dictionary into a database you must first install the
tsearch2 contrib module and load the ``tsearch2.sql`` file into the database
(which is usually located in the ``/usr/share/postgresql/contrib/`` directory.

To build the Italian stemmer you must start from a PostgreSQL source tree.


Full package installation
=========================

Unpack the dictionary archive in the ``contrib`` directory in a PostgreSQL
source tree::

    tar xzvf italian-fts-VERSION-ENCODING.tar.gz

Build the library and install the dictionary files::

    cd italian_fts_ENCODING
	make
	make install

Load the dictionary configuration in your database::

    psql -f italian_fts_ENCODING.sql mydict

A configuration named ``italian_ENCODING`` will be created in the database.


Installing only the spelling dictionary
=======================================

If you don't want to alter the source code you can install only the spelling
dictionary. In this case the words not recognized by the spelling dictionary
will be left unchanged instead of being stemmed.

To install the spelling dictionary unpack the package as explained before
but issue the following commands instead::

    make SPELL_ONLY=1
    make SPELL_ONLY=1 install

To create a dictionary configuration in your database::

    psql -f italian_fts_spell_ENCODING.sql mydict

A configuration named ``it_spell_ENCODING`` will be created in the database.

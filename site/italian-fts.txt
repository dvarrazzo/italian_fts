:Abstract: This package provides a dictionary and the other files required to
    perform *full text search* in Italian documents using the PostgreSQL_
    database.

    Using the provided dictionary, search operations in Italian documents can
    keep into account morphological variations of Italian words, such as verb
    conjugations.

Spelling Dictionary Informations
================================

This vocabulary has been generated from the MySpell OpenOffice.org vocabulary,
provided by the `progetto linguistico`_.

.. _progetto linguistico: http://linguistico.sourceforge.net/

The dictionary had to undergo an huge amount of transformations, and is now
quite unrecognizable from the original. Above all, all the verbal forms,
including irregular verbs, are now reduced to the infinite form. Furthermore,
for each verb, the construction with pronominal and reflexive particles are
recognized on gerund, present and past participle, imperative and infinite.

Great care has also been taken in reducing the different forms of adjectives
(male and female, singular and plural, superlatives) to a single normal form,
and to unify different forms of male and female (es. *ricercatore* and
*ricercatrice*: male and female form of "researcher").

Furthermore, in the original dictionary, many unrelated male and female nouns
were joined together as they were an adjective (es. *caso/casi* + *casa/case*,
with the unrelated meanings of "case(s)" and "house(s)"). Such false friends
have been mostly split apart to avoid false positives in search results, but
some of them may still lie around in the dictionary (this is a kind of error
that no Python script can help fixing...).

Some statistics about the current dictionary edition:

- **66,929** distinct roots,
- **7,300** completely conjugated verbs
- **1,943,826** distinct recognized terms
- **62** flags in the affix file
- **10,365** production rules in the affix file.


Presentation at PGDay
---------------------

The dictionary was presented at PGDay_ 2007, the first Italian PostgreSQL
conference. The slideshow_ is available for download.

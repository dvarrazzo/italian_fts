Package description
===================

This package contains an ISpell dictionary useful to perfrom high quality
full-text searches in Italian language documents. The package also contains
installation and configuration files.


Prerequisites

This package can be used to install and configure the ISpell dictionary in
PostgreSQL 8.3 databases. To install the dictionary in older database versions,
please refer to the homepage_.

.. _homepage: http://www.develer.com/~piro/ispell-italian/


Package installation
====================

Unpack the dictionary archive::

    tar xzvf italian-fts-VERSION.tar.gz

Install the dictionary files in the proper directories::

    cd italian_fts
    make install

Tou can install the dictionary in a database (*mydict* in the example)
with the command:

.. parsed-literal::

    psql -f $(pg_config --sharedir)/italian_fts.sql *mydict*

The command updates the ``italian`` default configuration: the new configuration
will use the ISpell dictionary, falling back on the stemmer upon unrecognized
words.
